		ii) Show FIS Java Console - Camel routes
		iii) Show gateway hawtio
	   Show Smart Gateway logs on TigerVNC

	d) Mike & Rick: Start the sensors (Rick: move red wire - Mike: Plug in USB hub)

	e) Mike: Show data coming in to Pi, then show Hawtio, then show Java Console with fewer hits.  Go back to gateway logs.
	f) Rick: So lets heat up the sensor - "don't try this at home, we're professionals" - count up the temp from the logs

	g) Light goes off & Slack message arrives.
	h) Mike: Open Slack message, click computer icon which opens BPMS.

	j) Mike: Ask Alexa: "Alexa, ask the gateway to conduct pre-flight checks on the drone"
		Alexa says: Well? The drone is operational, but "oh boy" Your Fitbit tells me that your heart rate has increased dramatically.  Are you sure you're okay to fly?"
		Rick: wait until Alexa is done and then get safety net.
		Mike: Take off and throw FitBit and say "It's just demo nerves Alexa, I'm sure I'll be fine." ... and press "Deploy Drone" button.
		Rick: "Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just use a webcam?"
		Mike: "Cheaper?  Yes.  Cooler?  No. --- Let's look at the sensor."
		Mike: Press Yellow button to popup sensor page, "Temps ok now, but light is on ... let me reach into 'internet' and fly this thing".
		Rick: Explain that this was accomplished with a conglomeration of many open source, node-js packages, while I launch the drone.
		(Rick gets into frame if needed).

		use clockwise gesture for "takeOff"
		Leave the drone hovering. 

(0:40)	k) Mike: Press '1' - Drone says: "Intruder detected! He appears to be armed, with ... a fishing net?! Shall I nuke the site from orbit?"

		Press '2' - Drone says" "But?  It's the only way to be sure."
		Mike: "Oh no!  Did you just roll your eye at me drone?"
		Rick: "Did that drone just quote Aliens? ... Why did you even add this capability?!?!?!"
		Mike: "To scare off intruders -- So Drone! ... scare off the intruder"
		Rick: quickly add, " ... but don't go nuclear"
		Press '3' - Drone says "Okay.  Hey!  Intruder!  Stop blowing that sensor!" --- This also gets data and sends to Alexa
		Mike: "Drone ... I don't think that means what you think that means ... You know what, it doesn't matter ... With the threat of nuclear annihilation, the bad guy leaves the sensor alone, and I can resolve the issue ... and the light should go out."

	l) On BPMS, press "Complete", light goes out, much rejoicing.

	Given time: (0:30~0:50 depending on Alexa)

	m) Mike & Rick: "Bonus demo!"
	n) Mike: Ask Alexa: "Alexa, ask the gateway for a status report"
(~0:15)	o) Rick: Explain that Alexa is going to report on live data from CDK on the datacenter, Docker on the smart gateway, BPMS and directly from the sensors themselves.
(0:22)  p) Alexa says: Status Report. The datacenter is running 5 pods.  The gateway is running 2 containers.  3 sensors are active.  You have 0 human tasks to complete.  Way to go.  The maximum sensor temperature was 32 degrees Celcius.  Drone was deployed.  DemoJam was conquered.  And there was much rejoicing.  Yay!"

	q) Mike & Rick: "Thank you! Good night!"
