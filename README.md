# IoT-DemoJam
Internet of Things DemoJam

Based on the projects from [Patrick Steiner](https://github.com/PatrickSteiner) forked elsewhere in my repositories here, I build a series of projects for a high-intensity DemoJam presentation.

After reviewing and removing passwords, etc. I will be adding the projects here with the title prefix of "IoT-DemoJam".

As many of these changes/enhancements are for theatrics and impracticle hardware configurations, I did not fork these from Mr. Steiner, but credit where credit is due.

This repository will contain the cross-cutting elements and instructions on how to build the entire chain.

As presentations go, the difficulty is 11 out of 10, as there are lots of "moving" parts, but when pulled off, it is an impressive chain of technologies.

More to come...
